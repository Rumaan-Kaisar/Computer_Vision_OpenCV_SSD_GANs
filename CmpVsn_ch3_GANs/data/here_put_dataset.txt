The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. 
CIFAR-10 is a labeled subset of the 80 Million Tiny Images dataset from 2008, published in 2009. When the dataset was created, students were paid to label all of the images.
